### CmdGoogle

Once upon a time, Google used to have a slew of experiments and 
public APIs while they were still trying to figure out what and
who they were, which gender, and so on.

Eventaully they took it all down. So this code doesn't work. What
this code did was query Google from the command line, with pagination
support.
