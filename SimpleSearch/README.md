This is code I was writing out of frustration with how Microsoft changed
the way Windows does file searches. I usually don't care for metadata 
searches. (Still don't.) If I'm searching for something I usually only
want search done on filenames and optionally on text content.

I don't know if this code was ever baked enough to be functional. But I
do know that Agent Ransack is where it's at, so that's all I need.
