Would you believe that in the late 90's / early 00's it was still 
considered new knowledge that browsers are single-threaded
and that this was considered a flaw? Today, we have background 
workers and other features in HTML 5 that accomodate parallel 
processing on the web browser, but back in the day it was a problem.

This folder was me trying to communicate to the world that it was a problem. LOL.
