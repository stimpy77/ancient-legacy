# *Why, hello there, stranger!*

## About the *ancient-legacy* repos

Many, many years ago, starting from going back to something like the year 2000 or so, I (Jon Davis) used to 
host ***coding experiments and community contributions*** directly on my personal computer at home
via my cable modem, bypassing port restrictions to get them up and available. (I actually still do this for
a few things, but let's not talk about that ...) So for a long time I kept these files available
for direct download, but as time has gone on it seems that IIS has been so thoroughly exploited
that it is impossible to keep them available that way without people hacking into my machine and installing viruses
and other malware.

So the tidbits are uploaded here, with a few README.md files thrown in as I try to guess and explain
what I think the tidbits are.

Have fun rummaging through my old attic!
