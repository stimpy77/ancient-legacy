These changes were put in my task queue, and then completed for v1.1:

* Need to drop "wait" usage for local scripts loaded asynchronously 
by going back to using an AJAX call rather than src="" call 

* Need to rewrite the output objects of using.register() to a defined 
structure / model rather than what I have now which is a name/value 
pair where value is either string or object presumed to be an array and 
the array values are typeof()-evaluated as integer (async post-load 
milliseconds), boolean (true for remote domain), or string for URL. 
Bleah, too disorganized! 

* Need to actually test and finalize the half-implemented "sender" param!! 

* Want to add support for subdependencies, i.e. maybe something like .. 

using.register("jquery", 
	"/scripst/jquery.js"); 
	
using.register("jquery.blockui", 
		"/scripts/jquery-blockui.js" 
	).require("jquery"); 

using("jquery.blockui", function() { // loads *both* jquery and blockUI 
		$("myTable").blockUI(); 
	});
