This tests the speed of the user's Internet connection by sending a small
payload and sending a large payload, measuring the time taken, and 
subtracting the latency (small) from the large.

This is mine. You're free to reuse, but in your source please credit me! ;)
Also, if this proved usable for your site, let me know, I'd like to hear 
about it!
